# Replicating-ViT-Research-Paper: Emotion Detection from Facial Images using Vision Transformers🎭📝💻

This is my attempt to replicate the Vision Transformer Paper **"AN IMAGE IS WORTH 16X16 WORDS: TRANSFORMERS FOR IMAGE RECOGNITION AT SCALE"** from scratch using *PyTorch*.

For this project I'm using ViT to classify human emotions (Happy , Angry , Sad). This project is heavily inspired by the Mr. Daniel Bourke's Online Pytorch Course, which helped me in providing foundation and approach for implementing ViT in a modular and scalable way.

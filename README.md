# 1. Project Overview 📝

This project replicates the **Vision Transformer (ViT)** Architecture from the groundbreaking 2020 research paper , "An Image is Worth 16x16 Words" and applies it to plant disease classification.

I replicated a ViT from scratch using PyTorch , and  trained it on a 3-class subset of the PlantVillage Dataset(Kaggle) to study the architecture's behaviour under limited data conditions , and then fine-tuned a Pretrained ViT(ViT_B_16) to achieve a strong classification performance.

The ultimate goal is to deploy a mobile friendly plant disease detection app for farmers.
